    <h2>Proposition: Ease of Business and Technology Exports Lead to Higher GDP and Lower Unemployment Rates</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					The video shows an animated scatter plot visualising global data from 2007-2022. Each dot on the plot represents a country. The size of the dot represents the technology exports made by the country. The higher the exports, the bigger the bubble. The X-axis represents the GDP on a log scale. The Y-axis represents the unemployment rate. The colour of the bubbles represent the ease of business global. The year is displayed in grey on the chart. 
					<bbr><br>
				<br></bbr>
					We can see that the countries with green colour and bigger size, representing higher ease of business and larger technology exports respectively, predominantly occupy the lower right of the chart, indicating lower unemployment rates and higher GDP.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b> Animated Scatter Plot: </b> My hypothesis involved multiple variables and complex analysis. It was challenging to come up a visualisation that could use six variables (unemployment rate, GDP, ease of business index, technology exports, year, and countries) in a single visualisation. Therefore, I decided to use an animated scatter plot to fit all details coherently. Moreoever, animations would help readers see the trend across a longer time frame, persuading them that such a trend is not one off but consistent across several years.  <br> 
				<b>Earnesty Score: 2/2</b> Animation was done as is, no deceptions added. </li></br>
				<li><b>Colour Scheme: </b> I chose a standard RGB colour scheme to enable clear distinction of ease of business scale, but I chose green colour to bias people towards my argument that ease of business is "greener", meaning "the right or the better thing to do" so that the big green dots shine out on the plot.  </li>
				<b>Earnesty Score: -1/2</b> As pointed out, colour scheme contains some bias towards ease of business use due to the use of green colour to indicate higher ease of business.  </li></br>
				</br>
				<li><b>Use of Log Scale:</b> My dataset comprises 164 countries! And many of them do not have GDP in a uniformly spread out range. If I didn't use the log scale, my visualisation would have all the countries with lesser or moderate ease of business pushed to the left and the countries with more ease of business spread on the graph. Now, while this would have actually made my visualisation more and not less persuasive, it would have also made my analysis too unbelievable and less readable because the all the other dots, except green would be concentrated in a small portion of the plot. I wanted to give credit to my readers that they can pick on such a nuance and hence, used a log scale. 
				<b>Earnesty Score: 2/2</b> Log scale was used to make the plot more readable and believable. No deception was used.  </li></br>
	</br> 
				<li><b>Choice of Axis and Representations:</b> I have seen animated scatter plots before and choosing year to be the moving window and countries as the dots was an obvious choice. Choosing GDP on x-axis was an intuitive choice because that's the quantity that we expect to change over larger range within a year, as compared to the unemployment rate, which is much slower to move and covers a much shorter range of scale, deeming it a better fit for the y-axis in accordance to the standard "landscape" view of a scatter plot. Further, I converted the world bank ease of business rank into three categories - low, moderate, and high, wherein higher score indicated lower rank. This data was also available for only one year. In contrast, the tech export data changed annually and available for several years, making it an interesting choice for the changing dot size. All of these decisions also helped make the chart much more persuasive, especially with the green big bubbles dominating the plot overall, which is what we wanted to prove. 
				</li> 
				
				<b>Earnesty Score: 1.5/2</b> I would say that there were minor deceptions used in choice of axis, if any, as most of the decisions were made to make a neat and clear visualisation for the readers and not particularly to persuade them.  </li></br>
				
				</br> 
				<li><b>Range of Years:</b> I wanted to include recent data but also prove that such a trend is not recent but consistent across several years. I had good data starting 2001, so I picked the range 2007-2022, 16 years seemed like a good range to show how far countries (especially the biggest green dot that represents China) have come along and have had their GDP increase due to tech exports. 
				</li> 
				
				<b>Earnesty Score: 1.5/2</b> While there is perceivably no deception here, one could argue that such a choice of years could be deceptive as the trend in recent years may not be similar or other factors could be driving GDP far more than tech exports etc., hence I have given a modest 1.5 score here.   </li></br>
