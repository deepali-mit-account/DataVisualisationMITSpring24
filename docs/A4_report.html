					The video shows an animated scatter plot visualising global data from 2007-2022. Each dot on the plot represents a country. There are 166 countries on the plot. The size of the dot represents the technology exports made by the country. The higher the exports, the bigger the bubble. The X-axis represents the GDP on a log scale. The Y-axis represents the unemployment rate. The colour of the bubbles represent the ease of business globally. The year is displayed in grey in the animation.  
					<bbr><br>
				<br></bbr>
					We can see that the countries with green colour and bigger size, representing higher ease of business and larger technology exports respectively, predominantly occupy the lower right of the chart, indicating lower unemployment rates and higher GDP.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b> Animated Scatter Plot: </b> My hypothesis involved multiple variables and complex analysis. It was challenging to come up a visualisation that could use six variables (unemployment rate, GDP, ease of business index, technology exports, year, and countries) in a single visualisation. Therefore, I decided to use an animated scatter plot to fit all details coherently. Moreoever, animations would help readers see the trend across a longer time frame, persuading them that such a trend is not one off but consistent across several years.  <br> 
				<b>Earnesty Score: 2/2</b> Animation was done as is, no deceptions added. </li></br>
				<li><b>Colour Scheme: </b> I chose a standard RGB colour scheme to enable clear distinction of ease of business scale, but I chose green colour to bias people towards my argument that ease of business is "greener", meaning "the right or the better thing to do" so that the big green dots shine out on the plot.  </li><br>
				<b>Earnesty Score: -1/2</b> As pointed out, colour scheme contains some bias towards ease of business use due to the use of green colour to indicate higher ease of business.  </li></br>
				</br>
				<li><b>Use of Log Scale:</b> My dataset comprises 164 countries! And many of them do not have GDP in a uniformly spread out range. If I didn't use the log scale, my visualisation would have all the countries with lesser or moderate ease of business pushed to the left and the countries with more ease of business spread on the graph. Now, while this would have actually made my visualisation more and not less persuasive, it would have also made my analysis too unbelievable and less readable because the all the other dots, except green would be concentrated in a small portion of the plot. I wanted to give credit to my readers that they can pick on such a nuance and hence, used a log scale. 
				<b>Earnesty Score: 2/2</b> Log scale was used to make the plot more readable and believable. No deception was used.  </li></br>
				<li><b>Choice of Axis and Representations:</b> I have seen animated scatter plots before and choosing year to be the moving window and countries as the dots was an obvious choice. Choosing GDP on x-axis was an intuitive choice because that's the quantity that we expect to change over larger range within a year, as compared to the unemployment rate, which is much slower to move and covers a much shorter range of scale, deeming it a better fit for the y-axis in accordance to the standard "landscape" view of a scatter plot. Further, I converted the world bank ease of business rank into three categories - low, moderate, and high, wherein higher score indicated lower rank. This data was also available for only one year. In contrast, the tech export data changed annually and available for several years, making it an interesting choice for the changing dot size. All of these decisions also helped make the chart much more persuasive, especially with the green big bubbles dominating the plot overall, which is what we wanted to prove. 
				</li> 
				
				<b>Earnesty Score: 1.5/2</b> I would say that there were minor deceptions used in choice of axis, if any, as most of the decisions were made to make a neat and clear visualisation for the readers and not particularly to persuade them.  </li></br>
				
				</br> 
				<li><b>Range of Years:</b> I wanted to include recent data but also prove that such a trend is not recent but consistent across several years. I had good data starting 2001, so I picked the range 2007-2022, 16 years seemed like a good range to show how far countries (especially the biggest green dot that represents China) have come along and have had their GDP increase due to tech exports. 
				</li> 
				
				<b>Earnesty Score: 1.5/2</b> While there is perceivably no deception here, one could argue that such a choice of years could be deceptive as the trend in recent years may not be similar or other factors could be driving GDP far more than tech exports etc., hence I have given a modest 1.5 score here.   </li></br>

					The video shows an animated scatter plot visualising global data from 2007-2015. Each dot on the plot represents a country. There are 87 countries on the plot. The size of the dot represents the technology exports made by the country. The smaller the exports, the smaller the dot size. The X-axis represents the GDP (in millians USD) on a linear scale. The Y-axis represents the unemployment rate (in %). The colour of the bubbles represent the ease of business globally. The year is displayed in grey in the animation.

				<br></bbr>
					We can see that the countries with pink/green colour and bigger in size, representing higher ease of business and larger technology exports respectively, predominantly occupy the upper portion of the chart, indicating higher unemployment rates. In contrast blue dots represent lower unemployment rates.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b> Animated Scatter Plot: </b> Again, my hypothesis involved multiple variables and complex analysis. It was challenging to come up a visualisation that could use six variables (unemployment rate, GDP, ease of business index, technology exports, year, and countries) in a single visualisation. Therefore, I decided to use an animated scatter plot to fit all details coherently. Moreoever, animations would help readers see the trend across a longer time frame, persuading them that such a trend is not one off but consistent across several years.  <br> 
				<b>Earnesty Score: 2/2</b> Animation was done as is, no deceptions added. </li></br>
				
				<li><b>Colour Scheme: </b> I chose a standard RGB colour scheme to enable clear distinction of ease of business scale. I kept the colour scheme the same as before. No deception was added. For the opposing narrative, I wanted smaller and lower dots to shine out. Given the colour scheme, a darker colour such as blue would be more catchy than a lighter green tone.  </li> <br>
				<b>Earnesty Score: 0.5/2</b> Colour scheme contains no bias, perhaps a slight preference towards a darker shade for lower ease of business and lesser tech exports so that the smaller dots are distinctly visible. </li></br>
				</br>
				<li><b>Use of Linear Scale:</b> My dataset comprises 87 countries so a log scale wasn't necessary to manage the complexity. A linear scale ensures that the absolute differences are clearly visible. However, a linear scale is also a zoomed in view. For GDPs changing by only 100-200 million of countries, a linear scale makes the data change less evidentl. For our narrative that "there is no impact on GDP", a linear sclae is perfect. It makes a perception that indeed no significant change in GDP is taking place. 
				
				<b>Earnesty Score: -2/2</b> Changing the scale from log to linear made the changes in GDP appear non-significant which isn't the case. Such a switch also presented a zoomed in view.  </li></br>
				<li><b>Removal of Outliers:</b> I removed bottom 10% of outliers that had high ease of business and high GDP. The removal of 10% outliers isn't a significant change, but for a dataset of 87, it's perhaps significant enough to somewhat sway the narrative. I did so also to scale the data better and show bigger blue dots for smaller tech exports as against smaller in size dots, since the latter would make the GDP values of countries that are not exporting tech goods look smaller, opposite of what my narrative was. 
				</li> 
				
				<b>Earnesty Score: -1.5/2</b> I have used considerable deception here to remove outliers to make the opposing view more persuasive.  </li></br>
				
				</br> 
				<li><b>Range of Years:</b> Range of years is the key difference against all other design decisions that make one visualisation for and the other against. By focusing on 2007-2015, I zoomed categorically into the years of economic depression wherein unemployment rates where any way high. In fact, more so for a country exporting tech goods and the one that had ease of business than other countries that never did tech exports or had ease of business and were self sufficient. 
				</li> 
				
				<b>Earnesty Score: -2/2</b> I used significant deception to only choose years of economic depression to dissuade readers from the narrative that ease of business can be conducive to the economy.   </li></br>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">The design process across both visualizations shows the complex interplay between data presentation and the intended message. One of the straightforward aspects was the selection of an animated scatter plot to handle multiple variables and visualize trends over time, which conveyed complex relationships between ease of business, technology exports, GDP, and unemployment rates. However, the challenge lay in making design decisions that could either illuminate or obscure the data's true narrative, underscoring the fine line between persuasive and deceptive visualizations. Of course, for the expected hypothesis that ease of business and tech exports should lead to higher GDP, it was much easier to create the visualisation with minimal deception, as is evident from my scoring in the first visualisation. My hardest challenge was to do the opposite. How do I create a deception for a well established and known hypothesis? After deep exploration of the data, I came up with the 2009 economic depression hypothesis, which worked for the "Against" narrative. </p> 

 <p style="text-align: justify;">What surprised me was how subtle design choices, such as color schemes, the scale of axes, and the selection of data ranges, could significantly influence the viewer's perception and interpretation of the data. One of the key surprises for me was the emergence of the visualisation's narrative. It wasn't one thing but subtle small changes that collectively indicated a drammatic change of opinion. I was surprised to see how log to linear scaling could bring such a drammatic effect on the narrative. The choice of visualization design elements—such as color schemes, scales, and data ranges—can also subtly guide the viewer towards a specific interpretation or conclusion. For example, using a green color to indicate high ease of business might imply that it is inherently good, influencing the viewer's perception before they fully engage with the data. This manipulation, whether intentional or not, raises ethical questions about the responsibility of data analysts and visualizers to present information in an unbiased and neutral manner. Lastly, the selection of data ranges and the decision to include or exclude certain data points, such as outliers, can dramatically alter the narrative. Focusing on years of economic depression to argue that ease of business and technology exports lead to higher unemployment rates, while excluding more prosperous years, demonstrates how data can be cherry-picked to support a specific argument. This practice not only misleads the public but can also have real-world consequences if policymakers use such biased analyses to make decisions. </p> 

 <p style="text-align: justify;">The contrasting narratives surrounding the impact of ease of business and technology exports on GDP and unemployment rates, as presented through data visualizations, bring to light significant ethical implications. These implications revolve around the power of data visualization to shape public opinion, inform policy decisions, and ultimately affect lives and economies on a global scale. Misleading visualizations can erode public trust in data and statistics, leading to skepticism and cynicism about factual evidence. This is particularly dangerous in a world where policy and economic decisions increasingly rely on data analytics. Misinterpretation of data can lead to policies that might harm rather than help economies, especially if decisions are based on a flawed understanding of the relationship between ease of business, technology exports, GDP, and unemployment rates.In this context, ethical analysis and visualization mean ensuring accuracy, transparency, and neutrality. Analysts and visualizers must critically evaluate their design choices, openly discuss the limitations of their data, and consider the potential impact of their work on public opinion and policy making. They should strive to present data in a way that is accessible and understandable to a broad audience, without sacrificing the integrity of the information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

Ethical analysis and visualization, as I define it now, involves presenting data in a manner that is both honest and transparent, while carefully considering how design decisions can influence interpretation. It requires a balance between persuasiveness and integrity, ensuring that visualizations do not mislead or manipulate the viewer. Acceptable persuasive choices enhance understanding and allow the data to speak for itself, even when they are framed within a specific narrative. Misleading ones, however, intentionally obscure, distort, or omit information to sway the viewer towards a particular viewpoint. Ultimately, distinguishing between "acceptable" persuasive choices and "misleading" ones hinges on the intention to inform versus the intention to deceive. Ethical visualizations seek to enlighten and educate, allowing viewers to draw their own informed conclusions, whereas unethical ones aim to manipulate public opinion for specific agendas. In the debate over the impact of ease of business and technology exports, it becomes crucial to uphold ethical standards in data analysis and visualization, ensuring that the narratives presented are grounded in truth and presented with the intent to inform rather than mislead.</p>
