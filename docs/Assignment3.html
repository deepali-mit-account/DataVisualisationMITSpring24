			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="A3 Images/visn.png" alt="" width="900" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption style="text-align: justify;">>
					The visualisation features a color-coded pictogram illustrating the growth in the population of males and females over 60 years old in the United States from 1900 to 2000. Each square represents 1 million individuals, with green squares indicating males, blue squares representing females, and the yellow squares at the top representing the segment of the population over 60 years old. The comparison between the years 1900 and 2000 shows a significant increase in both the overall population and the proportion of the population over 60, highlighting the demographic changes and aging of the population throughout the century.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">I wanted the visualization to answer the question “what are some gender-wise trends in the aging population?”. As the first step, I only wanted to see what percentage or magnitude of people in the age group of 60+ years comprise the entire population. I assumed that each square representing 1 million individuals allows would allow viewers to grasp the magnitude of the population visually, which can be more impactful than just numbers. I also used distinct colours to allow for immediate visual differentiation and comparison. </li>

				<li style="text-align: justify;">There are a few things that this chart does well. Firstly, the use of color blocks makes the information immediately visually impactful and can convey the message at a glance. Secondly, The pictorial representation is intuitive. Viewers do not need to understand complex graphs or statistics to get the information. Thirdly, The side-by-side layout for the two years allows for easy comparison of demographic changes over time. Lastly, the design is simple and avoids unnecessary details that could confuse the message. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">What this chart doesn’t do well though is that it doesn't help study precise numbers or percentages. We cannot intuitively determine the quantitative numbers. It is less effective for displaying more detailed data breakdowns or more complex demographic information. It also gives no information within the aging population. How many are in the age bracket of 60 or 85? The graph gives no information about that. As the next step, I would map out data more quantitatively for each age bracket above 60 years of age to study the trends. </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="A3 Images/V2.png" alt="" width="900" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption style="text-align: justify;">
          
These graphs illustrate the trends in population changes for US males and females over 60 years of age between 1900 and 2000. The male population is on the left, showing a significant increase from 1900 to 2000  in the older age groups. The female population graph on the right also shows growth over the century. These trends may suggest improvements in healthcare and living conditions, contributing to longer lifespans.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">As indicated before, as the next step, I wanted to study all data points more quantitatively on one chart to capture any holistic trends.  I chose to start with a simple line-chart as lines connect the data points for each year, clearly showing the trend from one age bracket to the next. This helps to quickly grasp how the population changes within each age group over time. The graphs also simultaneously show data for 1900 and 2000. This direct comparison allows viewers to easily see the changes in population distribution over the century. I used similar colours for both charts to avoid visual clutter. I was also hoping to prioritize clarity, direct comparison, and trend visualization. </li>

				<li style="text-align: justify;">What works well here is that the chart does a nice job in visualizing some interesting insights between both genders from a bird’s eye view. We can clearly see how much the population has changed in 100 years - from the order of thousands to the order of millions. We can also see some other interesting trends. For example, in the year 1900, females were fewer than men, albeit the difference was proportionally lesser and in the year 2000, this statistic was flipped and there were more females than males in the aged population, indicating that in the year 2000, women lived longer as opposed to in the year 1900. I also like the simplicity of line charts; They help visualize any changes clearly and concisely. For example, we can clearly see a downward trend for all genders for increasing age. There is one slight anomaly between the age of 65 years and 70 years for females in the year 2000; There are more females aged 70 years than 65 years. The beauty of a line chart is that such differences clearly jump out. </li>
				
				<li style="text-align: justify;">Some things don’t work well in this chart. Firstly, the chart doesn’t necessarily help compare the proportional difference between genders in 2000 and in 1900. For instance, we cannot easily tell the proportional difference between number of females in 1900 and in 2000, did they improve for the 90+ years age bracket or remained the same? Do we have more people in 60 years age bracket? We cannot tell. Secondly, we cannot directly compare males and females for each year. There is some cognitive overload involved in  doing that. As the next step, I would want to understand the percentage increase or decrease for each age group for each gender between 1900 and 2000. For example, I would want to know whether the female population aged 65 years proportionally the same or different in the year 2000 as compared to in the year 1900. I would also visualise in such a way that I can compare males and females directly.  </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="A3 Images/V3.png" alt="" width="900" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption style="text-align: justify;">
          This graph depicts the change in percentage contribution of different aging groups (individuals aged 60 and above) in the aging population across the century. It length of the extending bars from the gender symbols indicate the increase or decrease in the proportion of each age group from one year to the next. The negative axis shows the decrease and the positive axis shows the increase. Notably, there is a significant decrease in the younger age groups (60 and 65) for both genders, while there is an increase in the older age groups (70 and above), more pronounced in the 80+ categories. This could illustrate an aging population with a growing proportion of older individuals or maybe even a decrease of birth rates in 1940s.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">I chose this design for several reasons. First, as mentioned, I wanted to directly compare changes in male population with those in female population. Secondly, the graph emphasizes the percentage change rather than the absolute numbers, which is valuable for highlighting trends. Thirdly, the alignment of age groups on the horizontal axis with corresponding changes on the vertical axis makes it easy to track the trends for each age group. To make the visualisation stand out, I used gender symbols and the length of the symol to denote the change in percentage. I thought it made the visualisation more memorable, and catchy. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The chart does a great job at giving us an in-depth analysis. Some very interesting insights jump out from the analysis. For instance, for males, the proportion of men in the age group of 70 years remains almost the same in both the year 2000 and the year 1900. However, the proportion of men in the age group of 60 years in 2000 is much lesser than the proportion of men in the age group of 60 years in 1900. Moreover, this trend is reversed for the age of 80, 85, and 90, wherein clearly men aged 80, 85, and 90, have not only increased in absolute numbers but also proportionally contribute to the aging population much more in 2000 than in 1900. Interestingly, we observe similar trends in females as well, making one wonder why proportionally the contribution of people aged 60 has reduced to the aged population across both the genders. This statistic could indicate that somewhere there was a slight decrease in birth rate in the year 1940. In fact, 1940s were the tail end of the Great Depression of 1929 and of the world wars, resulting in fewer marriages and falling birthrates. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The chart does an excellent job at helping us view a nuanced distribution of each age group in the aging population between both genders. However, it still doesn’t help me understand trends from an overall population standpoint. Maybe, as the next step, one should visualize the data for all the age groups and not just the old age groups to see how the change has been for each age group proportionally. Moreoever, without the context of absolute numbers, it may be hard to grasp the real-world significance of these percentage changes. Lastly, some viewers may not immediately grasp the meaning of the different markers (circles for females and crosses for males) unless they are familiar with such conventions or it is clearly explained.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Each sketch takes a different approach to visualize the gender trends in the aging population, offering distinct insights. The first chart uses color blocks in a pictogram format to represent population counts by gender and age over time, giving an immediate visual impact and simplicity but lacking in precise data representation and scalability for larger datasets. The line chart presents a straightforward, bird’s-eye view of absolute number changes over time, facilitating the observation of broader trends and anomalies such as the increased longevity of females by 2000. Nevertheless, it falls short in illustrating proportional differences within each gender over the two centuries. The third visualisation employs a line graph with error bars to illustrate the percentage change in age group contribution over time, highlighting trends and allowing for comparison of relative changes, yet it could potentially be misinterpreted without proper labels and may not convey the absolute population changes effectively.  However, even the third one is far from perfect and doesn't provide an overall population trend perspective, which could be valuable for holistic understanding. Each design offers a unique perspective on the data, with the pictogram providing a quick visual summary, the line graph emphasizing relative change, and the pyramid graphs focusing on population structure. However, the first might oversimplify, the second could obscure absolute values, and the third might introduce confusion due to its unconventional representation for males. Interestingly, all three visualisations offer a valid and informative answer to original question of "what are some gender-wise trends in the aging population?" but from different angles. 

        </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
One key lesson that I learned through this exercise and in class in general is that the narrative and the story are far more important in choosing a visualization over any other factor. For instance, if I want to show that female aging population is higher than male aging population in the year 2000, the first visualisation would work just fine. However, if I am trying to reverse engineer birth rates from the aging population, the more nuanced third visualisation  would work the best in seeing the proportional differences of each age bracket. Therefore, which visualization would work the best depends on the context. 
</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
In the next phase of design exploration, one might consider best elements from each sketch to leverage their individual strengths. For example, combining the clear quantitative representation of the pictogram with the trend-visualization capacity of the line graph could yield a better visualisation. Added with the precise data points could help in understanding demographic shifts in context of the aging population. Outside the scope of this assignment, I’d also be intrigued to try interactive data visualization that we studied in class lecture for this problem. For example, sliders could adjust for the year, and users could toggle between different types of visualizations or demographic breakdowns. In the next phase, I can also explore age distribution by gender.  I can create separate histograms or density plots for different years (e.g., 1900 vs. 2000) to show the age distribution of the population, segmented by gender. This can illustrate how the overall age distribution has shifted over time and highlight differences in aging trends between genders. I can also build a population pyramid for specific years, which can illustrate the age and sex distribution. By comparing pyramids from different years, we can visualize changes in the aging population over time, including differences in life expectancy and birth rates between genders. Again, it depends on the narrative. For me, exploring all age brackets in the next phase makes sense as I haven’t done that in either of my three sketches in phase 1.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="A3 Images/main viz.png" alt="" width="900" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption style="text-align: justify;">
				This population pyramid compares the gender distribution within different age groups for the years 1900 and 2000. The left side of each pyramid represents males, and the right side represents females, with the colors blue for the year 1900 and red for the year 2000. Each horizontal bar corresponds to an age group, or "bin," with the length of the bar representing the size of the population within that age group. As we move up the pyramid, the age groups increase, from 5 years at the bottom to 90 at the top. The pyramids show that in both years, the younger age groups have larger populations. Notably, the top of the pyramids, which represent the oldest age groups, show a more significant increase in population size, highlighting an increase in life expectancy and a growing proportion of older individuals in the population. We also see a shift in the age group of 35-45 yrs in 2000, indicating a change in birth rates across the century, perhaps a dip in 1990s and an increase in 1960s.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">
The story I aim to tell centers on the question, &quot;<strong>How has the gender distribution within age groups changed over the century?</strong>&quot; This question is significant, particularly for understanding shifts in population demographics and gender trends within aging populations. A century includes social, economic, and health-related changes that directly affect birth rates, death rates, life expectancy, and migration patterns. Observing the gender distribution within age groups over time can provide insights into these shifts, which can influence a range of sectors including healthcare, policymaking, and economic planning, ensuring they adapt to the changing needs of the population. For example, just by looking at the visualization we can clearly see that the maximum males and females are in the 35-45 age group suggesting something about the birth rate in 1960s and a decline in birth rates in the 1980s.        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
A <strong>population pyramid</strong> seemed like a perfect choice in answering this question for several reasons. First, it displays the distribution of age and gender within a population simultaneously. It lets us view both genders together and in relation with each other for all age groups. This <strong>dual-axis format</strong> facilitates immediate comparison between male and female populations across different age groups, a task that is less direct in single-axis charts like bars or line graphs. Second, <strong>the pyramid shape</strong> effectively shows the age structure of a population. Young populations have a broad base that narrows towards older age groups, and balanced populations display a more uniform distribution across age groups. The <strong>shape and structur</strong>e also provide insights into social and economic conditions. For example, significant dips in certain age cohorts can indicate historical events like wars, economic crises, or major health events that have impacted birth rates or mortality. Third, population pyramids enable <strong>easy comparison</strong> between different populations or the same population at different points in time, which is particularly useful for understanding demographic trends such as the impact of birth rates, death rates, and migration over time. Lastly, population pyramids are <strong>easy to interpret</strong> and relatively simple to understand for various audiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In terms of visual encodings, each decision was made with several trade-offs in mind. I chose bars as the <strong>visualization</strong> <strong>mark</strong> type because they are exceptionally effective for comparing quantities across different categories. They facilitate straightforward assessment of each category&apos;s magnitude visually. In my case, I wanted to compare each age group with each gender for each year, making bars the most effective mark. In contrast, points or lines would leave too much white space in the visualization and also make it cognitively demanding. I chose the <strong>size</strong> to be somewhere between medium and the highest scale in Tableau. Thin bars created too much white space, and overly thick bars merged with each other, creating a stepped area visualization, which obscured the distinction between each horizontal age group. I also spent significant time selecting <strong>colors</strong>, aiming to use gender-neutral colors and avoid perpetuating biases like pink for women and sky blue for men. I initially used &quot;green&quot; and &quot;purple,&quot; but these did not make the visualization as impactful as the &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;red&quot; tones did. Regarding <strong>scale</strong>, the y-axis was straightforward as there are only so many age bins, consistent across the board. However, the x-axis was challenging because most population sizes were in the millions and thousands, except for the 90+ age group in 1900. I had to make a trade-off and stick to the &quot;Million&quot; scale, which improved the visibility of changes in the 90+ population across the century, a key point of communication. I also <strong>sorted</strong> by age group in descending order to ensure the pyramid took on the traditional shape of tapering at the top, as that is what people are accustomed to reading, reducing the cognitive load for the audience. Due to my current design, what has been <strong>downplayed</strong> is the comparison of each gender with itself across the century. For example, it cannot directly answer a question like &quot;How has the women&apos;s population changed from 2000 compared to 1900?&quot;
      </p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    
    My sketches from phase 1 certainly helped define my phase 2 sketch. As pointed out in my earlier reflection, I was looking to combine the best from all three sketches - the first one was visually quite impactful, the second focused more on numbers and data, and the third showed comparisons. Population pyramid actually combines the best of all three of those objectives. It makes it visually intuitive to see the change in population distribution across age brackets. It helps view all numbers quantitatively. Lastly, we can also see proportional changes in gender population for each age group due to side by side comparisons. Additionally, in phase 1, I focused  much on the 60+ years population in every visualization that I missed the broader picture of how other age groups might have influenced the narrative, something that phase 2 helped me visualize. Sketching helped me realize the difficulty of representing all data points on one map. While sketching, I could only devise a line chart that used all data points holistically, which, although helpful, was not as effective in comparison, the main function I wanted to deliver. I was not personally familiar with pyramid charts, although I have used tornado diagrams in systems engineering before. It was through research on the internet that I discovered their applicability for this use case. They resonated with me as a tool for effectively understanding, and more importantly, in comparing the differences in gender distribution. I think my phase 1 is still useful, depending on the story I am telling, but for the question of "how gender distribution has changed over the century", the population pyramid provides the best answer. Lastly, plain to see but noteworthy was the realisation that sketching allows us to be much more creative than the tools available in the market. With existing tools, we are somewhat boxed in our thinking. Therefore, my decision to use the population pyramid also stemmed from lack of availability in implementing the more creative ideas that I had for phase 2.
