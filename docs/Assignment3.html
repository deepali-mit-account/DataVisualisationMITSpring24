				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">I wanted the visualization to answer the question “what are some of gender-wise trends in the aging population?”. I chose to start visualizing the absolute difference for each age group between both the genders in the year 1900 and the year 2000. More specifically, I wanted to understand how the population of each gender changed for each age group. I contemplated using several creative means, but I felt the age-old bar charts seemed to be the most effective in helping see direct comparisons. For instance, I can clearly see how impactful the change in women population above 90+. Years has been as compared to change for men in the same age bracket. To be more creative, I tried to draw the charts a bit artistically using gender symbols. I am not sure if it was a good try. It’s a hit or a miss. Many people may not prefer reading a diagonal chart, while others might find it aesthetic and self-explanatory in terms of which gender the bar graph represents. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">What this chart does well is to quickly visualize some key insights. First off, it helps clearly see the magnitude of improvement, indicated by the length of each bar for each age group. Secondly, I can clearly see that for females, the improvement in numbers in the year 2000 for 90+ age category has far better than that for men in the same category. Lastly, I can see a much higher proportional increase for women in each age bracket as compared to men. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">What this chart doesn’t do well though is help study the trends between males and females as clearly as we’d like. We still cannot tell whether there were more men or more women in the year 1900 aged more than 60 years. It also doesn’t help see holistic trends between age brackets. As the next step, I would want to study trends in the aging population holistically by considering probably all data points in one graph. </li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">As indicated before, as the next step, I wanted to study all data points on one chart to view any holistic trends.  I chose to start with a simple line-chart for both genders from both years so that I could visualize the change in absolute numbers for both male and female population for both the year 1900 and the year 2000. I was also hoping to use the line chart to find any anomalies or interesting insights in data. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">What works well here is that the chart does a nice job in visualizing some interesting insights between both genders from a bird’s eye view. We can clearly see how much the population has changed in 100 years - from the order of thousands to the order of millions. We can also see some other interesting trends. For example, in the year 1900, females were fewer than men, albeit the difference was proportionally lesser and in the year 2000, this statistic was flipped and there were more females than males in the aged population, indicating that in the year 2000, women lived longer as opposed to in the year 1900. I also like the simplicity of line charts; They help visualize any changes clearly and concisely. For example, we can clearly see a downward trend for all genders for increasing age. There is one slight anomaly between the age of 65 years and 70 years for females in the year 2000; There are more females aged 70 years than 65 years. The beauty of a line chart is that such differences clearly jump out. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">Three things don’t work well in this chart. Firstly, the chart doesn’t necessarily help compare the proportional difference between the same gender in 2000 and in 1900. For instance, due to scaling issues, we cannot easily tell the proportional difference between number of females in 1900 and in 2000, did they improve at 90 years of age or remained the same? Secondly, the chart doesn’t easily help compare any noticeable difference between each gender in 1900 and in 2000. For example, any trends categorically in the female population between 1900 and 2000 are not very clear. Thirdly, the colors purple and blue are also very confusing. I learned from this graph to use better colour contrasts. As the next step, I would want to understand the percentage increase or decrease for each age group for each gender between 1900 and 2000. For example, I would want to know whether the female population aged 65 years proportionally the same or different in the year 2000 as compared to in the year 1900. </li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The first chart clearly showed a huge change in population overall. But as discussed above, I chose to draw pie charts because I wanted to understand the proportional distribution of different age groups between each gender in 1900 and 2000. What I was hoping to get was an in-depth insight on whether the proportional increase in population has been the same for each age group in aging population or are there any variations?</li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The chart does a great job at giving us an in-depth analysis. Some very interesting insights jump out from the analysis. For instance, for males, the proportion of men in the age group of 70 years remains almost the same in both the year 2000 and the year 1900. However, the proportion of men in the age group of 60 years in 2000 is much lesser than the proportion of men in the age group of 60 years in 1900. Moreover, this trend is reversed for the age of 80, 85, and 90, wherein clearly men aged 80, 85, and 90, have not only increased in absolute numbers but also proportionally contribute to the aging population much more in 2000 than in 1900. Interestingly, we observe similar trends in females as well, making one wonder why proportionally the contribution of people aged 60 has reduced to the aged population across both the genders. This statistic could indicate that somewhere there was a slight decrease in birth rate in the year 1940. In fact, 1940s were the tail end of the Great Depression of 1929 and of the world wars, resulting in fewer marriages and falling birthrates. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The chart does an excellent job at helping us view a nuanced distribution of each age group in the aging population between both genders. However, it still doesn’t help me understand trends from an overall population standpoint. Maybe, as the next step, one should visualize the data for all the age groups and not just the old age groups to see how the change has been for each age group proportionally</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Reflecting on the three sketches, each sketch takes a different approach to visualize the gender trends in the aging population, offering distinct insights. The bar chart, with its creative gender-symbol styling, offers an immediate visual distinction between genders and a clear depiction of numerical growth over time, especially highlighting the dramatic increase in the female population for each age bracket as compared to male population. However, its diagonal layout may challenge conventional data reading practices, potentially hindering its effectiveness in communicating trends. Moreover, it fails to capture the bigger picture. The line chart presents a straightforward, bird’s-eye view of absolute number changes over time, facilitating the observation of broader trends and anomalies such as the increased longevity of females by 2000. Nevertheless, it falls short in illustrating proportional differences within each gender over the two centuries. The third visualization on proportional differences offers a nuanced view of differentiation within age groups, uncovering subtle trends such as the consistent proportion of males between 65 and 70 years old across both years. They reveal potential historical influences on population structure, like the birth rate dip around the 1940s. However, they do not provide an overall population trend perspective, which could be valuable for holistic understanding.
One key lesson that I learned through this exercise and in class in general is that the narrative and the story are far more important in choosing a visualization over any other factor. For instance, if I want to show that female aging population is higher than male aging population in the year 2000, a line chart would be perfect amongst the three visualizations. However, if I am trying to reverse engineer birth rates from the aging population, pie charts would work the best in seeing the proportional differences of each age bracket. Therefore, which visualization would work the best depends on the context. 
To explore a new direction, outside the scope of this assignment, I’d be intrigued to try interactive data visualization that we studied in class lecture for this problem. For example, sliders could adjust for the year, and users could toggle between different types of visualizations or demographic breakdowns. In the next phase, I can also explore age distribution by gender.  I can create separate histograms or density plots for different years (e.g., 1900 vs. 2000) to show the age distribution of the population, segmented by gender. This can illustrate how the overall age distribution has shifted over time and highlight differences in aging trends between genders. I can also build a population pyramid for specific years, which can illustrate the age and sex distribution. By comparing pyramids from different years, we can visualize changes in the aging population over time, including differences in life expectancy and birth rates between genders. Again, it depends on the narrative. For me, exploring all age brackets in the next phase makes sense as I haven’t done that in either of my three sketches in phase 1.
