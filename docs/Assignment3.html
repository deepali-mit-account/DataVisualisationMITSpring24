				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>1.	The question I wanted the visualization to answer was “what are some of gender-wise trends in the aging population?”. I chose to start visualizing the absolute difference for each age group between both the genders in the year 1900 and the year 2000. More specifically, I wanted to understand how the population of each gender changed for each age group. I contemplated using several creative means, but I felt the age-old bar charts seemed to be the most effective in helping see direct comparisons. For instance, I can clearly see how impactful the change in women population above 90+. Years has been as compared to change for men in the same age bracket. To be more creative, I tried to draw the charts a bit artistically using gender symbols. I am not sure if it was a good try. It’s a hit or a miss. Many people may not prefer reading a diagonal chart, while others might find it aesthetic and self-explanatory in terms of which gender the bar graph represents. </li>
				<li>2.	What this chart does well is to quickly visualize some key insights. First off, it helps clearly see the magnitude of improvement, indicated by the length of each bar for each age group. Secondly, I can clearly see that for females, the improvement in numbers in the year 2000 for 90+ age category has far better than that for men in the same category. Lastly, I can see a much higher proportional increase for women in each age bracket as compared to men. </li>
				<li>3.	What this chart doesn’t do well though is help study the trends between males and females as clearly as we’d like. We still cannot tell whether there were more men or more women in the year 1900 aged more than 60 years. It also doesn’t help see holistic trends between age brackets. As the next step, I would want to study trends in the aging population holistically by considering probably all data points in one graph. </li>
