			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>

				<figcaption style="text-align: justify;">>
					The visualisation features a color-coded pictogram illustrating the growth in the population of males and females over 60 years old in the United States from 1900 to 2000. Each square represents 1 million individuals, with green squares indicating males, blue squares representing females, and the yellow squares at the top representing the segment of the population over 60 years old. The comparison between the years 1900 and 2000 shows a significant increase in both the overall population and the proportion of the population over 60, highlighting the demographic changes and aging of the population throughout the century.

			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">I wanted the visualization to answer the question “what are gender-wise trends in the aging population?”. I chose to start visualizing the absolute difference for age brackets on and above 60 years of age between both the genders in the year 1900 and the year 2000. More specifically, I wanted to understand how the population of each gender changed for each age group. I contemplated using several creative means, but I felt the age-old bar charts seemed to be the most effective in helping see absolute comparisons. For instance, I can clearly see how impactful the change in women population above 90+ years is for women as compared to men in the same age bracket. To be more creative, I tried to draw the charts a bit artistically using gender symbols. It’s a hit or a miss. Many people may not prefer reading a diagonal chart, while others might find it aesthetic and self-explanatory in terms of which gender the bar graph represents. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">There are a few things that this chart does well. First off, it helps clearly see the magnitude of improvement, indicated by the length of each bar for each age group. Secondly, I can clearly see that for females, the improvement in numbers in the year 2000 for 90+ age category has far better than that for men in the same category. Lastly, I can see a much higher proportional increase for women in each age bracket as compared to men. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">What this chart doesn’t do well though is help study the trends between males and females in comparison to each other. We can tell how population of women has changed across the century but we still cannot tell whether there were more men or more women in the year 1900 in 60 years age bracket. It also doesn’t help see holistic trends between age brackets. While it's easy to see the difference within an age bracket for a given year, it's harder to compare the same age bracket across the two years because they are on separate graphs. As the next step, I would want to study trends in the aging population holistically by considering probably all data points in one graph. </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>

These graphs illustrate the trends in population changes for US males and females over 60 years of age between 1900 and 2000. The male population is on the left, showing a significant increase from 1900 to 2000  in the older age groups. The female population graph on the right also shows growth over the century. These trends may suggest improvements in healthcare and living conditions, contributing to longer lifespans.

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">As indicated before, as the next step, I wanted to study all data points on one chart to view any holistic trends.  I chose to start with a simple line-chart for both genders from both years so that I could visualize the change in absolute numbers for both male and female population for both the year 1900 and the year 2000. I was also hoping to use the line chart to find any anomalies or interesting insights in data. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">What works well here is that the chart does a nice job in visualizing some interesting insights between both genders from a bird’s eye view. We can clearly see how much the population has changed in 100 years - from the order of thousands to the order of millions. We can also see some other interesting trends. For example, in the year 1900, females were fewer than men, albeit the difference was proportionally lesser and in the year 2000, this statistic was flipped and there were more females than males in the aged population, indicating that in the year 2000, women lived longer as opposed to in the year 1900. I also like the simplicity of line charts; They help visualize any changes clearly and concisely. For example, we can clearly see a downward trend for all genders for increasing age. There is one slight anomaly between the age of 65 years and 70 years for females in the year 2000; There are more females aged 70 years than 65 years. The beauty of a line chart is that such differences clearly jump out. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">Three things don’t work well in this chart. Firstly, the chart doesn’t necessarily help compare the proportional difference between the same gender in 2000 and in 1900. For instance, due to scaling issues, we cannot easily tell the proportional difference between number of females in 1900 and in 2000, did they improve at 90 years of age or remained the same? Secondly, the chart doesn’t easily help compare any noticeable difference between each gender in 1900 and in 2000. For example, any trends categorically in the female population between 1900 and 2000 are not very clear. Thirdly, the colors purple and blue are also very confusing. I learned from this graph to use better colour contrasts. As the next step, I would want to understand the percentage increase or decrease for each age group for each gender between 1900 and 2000. For example, I would want to know whether the female population aged 65 years proportionally the same or different in the year 2000 as compared to in the year 1900. </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="A3 Images/V3.png" alt="" width="900" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption style="text-align: justify;">
          This graph depicts the change in percentage contribution of different aging groups (individuals aged 60 and above) in the aging population across the century. It length of the extending bars from the gender symbols indicate the increase or decrease in the proportion of each age group from one year to the next. The negative axis shows the decrease and the positive axis shows the increase. Notably, there is a significant decrease in the younger age groups (60 and 65) for both genders, while there is an increase in the older age groups (70 and above), more pronounced in the 80+ categories. This could illustrate an aging population with a growing proportion of older individuals or maybe even a decrease of birth rates in 1940s.

				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The first chart clearly showed a huge change in population overall. But as discussed above, I chose to draw pie charts because I wanted to understand the proportional distribution of different age groups between each gender in 1900 and 2000. What I was hoping to get was an in-depth insight on whether the proportional increase in population has been the same for each age group in aging population or are there any variations?</li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The chart does a great job at giving us an in-depth analysis. Some very interesting insights jump out from the analysis. For instance, for males, the proportion of men in the age group of 70 years remains almost the same in both the year 2000 and the year 1900. However, the proportion of men in the age group of 60 years in 2000 is much lesser than the proportion of men in the age group of 60 years in 1900. Moreover, this trend is reversed for the age of 80, 85, and 90, wherein clearly men aged 80, 85, and 90, have not only increased in absolute numbers but also proportionally contribute to the aging population much more in 2000 than in 1900. Interestingly, we observe similar trends in females as well, making one wonder why proportionally the contribution of people aged 60 has reduced to the aged population across both the genders. This statistic could indicate that somewhere there was a slight decrease in birth rate in the year 1940. In fact, 1940s were the tail end of the Great Depression of 1929 and of the world wars, resulting in fewer marriages and falling birthrates. </li>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">The chart does an excellent job at helping us view a nuanced distribution of each age group in the aging population between both genders. However, it still doesn’t help me understand trends from an overall population standpoint. Maybe, as the next step, one should visualize the data for all the age groups and not just the old age groups to see how the change has been for each age group proportionally</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Each sketch takes a different approach to visualize the gender trends in the aging population, offering distinct insights. The bar chart, with its creative gender-symbol styling, offers an immediate visual distinction between genders and a clear depiction of numerical growth over time, especially highlighting the dramatic increase in the female population for each age bracket as compared to male population. However, its diagonal layout may challenge conventional data reading practices, potentially hindering its effectiveness in communicating trends. Moreover, it fails to capture the bigger picture. The line chart presents a straightforward, bird’s-eye view of absolute number changes over time, facilitating the observation of broader trends and anomalies such as the increased longevity of females by 2000. Nevertheless, it falls short in illustrating proportional differences within each gender over the two centuries. The third visualization on proportional differences offers a nuanced view of differentiation within age groups, uncovering subtle trends such as the consistent proportion of males between 65 and 70 years old across both years. They reveal potential historical influences on population structure, like the birth rate dip around the 1940s. However, they do not provide an overall population trend perspective, which could be valuable for holistic understanding.
        </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
One key lesson that I learned through this exercise and in class in general is that the narrative and the story are far more important in choosing a visualization over any other factor. For instance, if I want to show that female aging population is higher than male aging population in the year 2000, a line chart would be perfect amongst the three visualizations. However, if I am trying to reverse engineer birth rates from the aging population, pie charts would work the best in seeing the proportional differences of each age bracket. Therefore, which visualization would work the best depends on the context. 
</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
To explore a new direction, outside the scope of this assignment, I’d be intrigued to try interactive data visualization that we studied in class lecture for this problem. For example, sliders could adjust for the year, and users could toggle between different types of visualizations or demographic breakdowns. In the next phase, I can also explore age distribution by gender.  I can create separate histograms or density plots for different years (e.g., 1900 vs. 2000) to show the age distribution of the population, segmented by gender. This can illustrate how the overall age distribution has shifted over time and highlight differences in aging trends between genders. I can also build a population pyramid for specific years, which can illustrate the age and sex distribution. By comparing pyramids from different years, we can visualize changes in the aging population over time, including differences in life expectancy and birth rates between genders. Again, it depends on the narrative. For me, exploring all age brackets in the next phase makes sense as I haven’t done that in either of my three sketches in phase 1.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

				<figcaption style="text-align: justify;">
				This population pyramid compares the gender distribution within different age groups for the years 1900 and 2000. The left side of each pyramid represents males, and the right side represents females, with the colors blue for the year 1900 and red for the year 2000. Each horizontal bar corresponds to an age group, or "bin," with the length of the bar representing the size of the population within that age group. As we move up the pyramid, the age groups increase, from 5 years at the bottom to 90 at the top. The pyramids show that in both years, the younger age groups have larger populations. Notably, the top of the pyramids, which represent the oldest age groups, show a more significant increase in population size, highlighting an increase in life expectancy and a growing proportion of older individuals in the population. We also see a shift in the age group of 35-45 yrs in 2000, indicating a change in birth rates across the century, perhaps a dip in 1990s and an increase in 1960s.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">
The story I aim to tell centers on the question, &quot;<strong>How has the gender distribution within age groups changed over the century?</strong>&quot; This question is significant, particularly for understanding shifts in population demographics and gender trends within aging populations. A century includes social, economic, and health-related changes that directly affect birth rates, death rates, life expectancy, and migration patterns. Observing the gender distribution within age groups over time can provide insights into these shifts, which can influence a range of sectors including healthcare, policymaking, and economic planning, ensuring they adapt to the changing needs of the population. For example, just by looking at the visualization we can clearly see that the maximum males and females are in the 35-45 age group suggesting something about the birth rate in 1960s and a decline in birth rates in the 1980s.        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
A <strong>population pyramid</strong> is beneficial in answering this question for several reasons. First, it displays the distribution of age and gender within a population simultaneously. It lets us view both genders together and in relation with each other for all age groups. This <strong>dual-axis format</strong> facilitates immediate comparison between male and female populations across different age groups, a task that is less direct in single-axis charts like bars or line graphs. Second, <strong>the pyramid shape</strong> effectively shows the age structure of a population. Young populations have a broad base that narrows towards older age groups, and balanced populations display a more uniform distribution across age groups. The <strong>shape and structur</strong>e also provide insights into social and economic conditions. For example, significant dips in certain age cohorts can indicate historical events like wars, economic crises, or major health events that have impacted birth rates or mortality. Third, population pyramids enable <strong>easy comparison</strong> between different populations or the same population at different points in time, which is particularly useful for understanding demographic trends such as the impact of birth rates, death rates, and migration over time. Lastly, population pyramids are <strong>easy to interpret</strong> and relatively simple to understand for various audiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In terms of visual encodings, each decision was made with several trade-offs in mind. I chose bars as the <strong>visualization</strong> <strong>mark</strong> type because they are exceptionally effective for comparing quantities across different categories. They facilitate straightforward assessment of each category&apos;s magnitude visually. In my case, I wanted to compare each age group with each gender for each year, making bars the most effective mark. In contrast, points or lines would leave too much white space in the visualization and also make it cognitively demanding. I chose the <strong>size</strong> to be somewhere between medium and the highest scale in Tableau. Thin bars created too much white space, and overly thick bars merged with each other, creating a stepped area visualization, which obscured the distinction between each horizontal age group. I also spent significant time selecting <strong>colors</strong>, aiming to use gender-neutral colors and avoid perpetuating biases like pink for women and sky blue for men. I initially used &quot;green&quot; and &quot;purple,&quot; but these did not make the visualization as impactful as the &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;red&quot; tones did. Regarding <strong>scale</strong>, the y-axis was straightforward as there are only so many age bins, consistent across the board. However, the x-axis was challenging because most population sizes were in the millions and thousands, except for the 90+ age group in 1900. I had to make a trade-off and stick to the &quot;Million&quot; scale, which improved the visibility of changes in the 90+ population across the century, a key point of communication. I also <strong>sorted</strong> by age group in descending order to ensure the pyramid took on the traditional shape of tapering at the top, as that is what people are accustomed to reading, reducing the cognitive load for the audience. Due to my current design, what has been <strong>downplayed</strong> is the comparison of each gender with itself across the century. For example, it cannot directly answer a question like &quot;How has the women&apos;s population changed from 2000 compared to 1900?&quot;
      </p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
        I realized that sketching allows us to be much more creative that I had initially thought. With existing tools, we are somewhat boxed in our thinking. Phase 1 certainly influenced my phase 2 design. In phase 1, I focused so much on the 60+ years population in every visualization that I missed the broader picture of how other age groups might have influenced the narrative, something that phase 2 helped me visualize. Sketching helped me realize the difficulty of representing all data points on one map. While sketching, I could only devise a line chart that used all data points holistically, which, although helpful, was not as effective in comparison, the main function I wanted to deliver. I was not personally familiar with pyramid charts, although I have used tornado diagrams in systems engineering before. It was through research on the internet that I discovered their applicability for this use case. They resonated with me as a tool for effectively understanding, and more importantly, in comparing the differences in gender distribution. I think my phase 1 is still useful, depending on the story I am telling. I would probably get rid of both the line chart and the bar charts in favor of the pyramid, but I would still perhaps used the pyramids to tell a more nuanced story, depending on the narrative.
